# Framework

I used node.js and Javascript for this app. I also used the following nope packages inquirer, axios, html-pdf, util, and fs.

# code example

The app utilizes classes to construct employees and their differentiating info

data is pushed to relevent array's then utilizing template literals html code is generated and returned data is organized and displayed

# Tests

Tests to ensure proper class constructor functioning all pass

# Improvements

The html is built layer by layer. This presents issues with time to return objects. I would have rather used jquery to ensure that the created html cards are directed into the proper location using Id's
